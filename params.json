{"name":"Pybozocrack","tagline":"A silly & effective MD5 cracker in Python","body":"# BozoCrack\r\nBozoCrack is a depressingly effective MD5 password hash cracker with almost zero CPU/GPU load. Instead of rainbow tables, dictionaries, or brute force, BozoCrack simply *finds* the plaintext password. Specifically, it googles the MD5 hash and hopes the plaintext appears somewhere on the first page of results.\r\n\r\nIt works way better than it ever should.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nBasic usage:\r\n\r\n    $ python bozocrack.py -f my_md5_hashes.txt\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n    $ python bozocrack.py -s fcf1eed8596699624167416a1e7e122e\r\n\r\nThe input file has no specified format. BozoCrack automatically picks up strings that look like MD5 hashes. A single line shouldn't contain more than one hash.\r\n\r\nExample with output:\r\n\r\n    $ python bozocrack.py -f example.txt\r\n    Loaded 5 unique hashes\r\n    fcf1eed8596699624167416a1e7e122e:octopus\r\n    bed128365216c019988915ed3add75fb:passw0rd\r\n    d0763edaa9d9bd2a9516280e9044d885:monkey\r\n    dfd8c10c1b9b58c8bf102225ae3be9eb:12081977\r\n    ede6b50e7b5826fe48fc1f0fe772c48f:1q2w3e4r5t6y\r\n\r\n    $ python bozocrack.py -s fcf1eed8596699624167416a1e7e122e\r\n    fcf1eed8596699624167416a1e7e122e:octopus\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nTo show just how bad an idea it is to use plain MD5 as a password hashing mechanism. Honestly, if the passwords can be cracked with *this software*, there are no excuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who?\r\nBozoCrack was originally written by [Juuso Salonen](http://twitter.com/juusosalonen), the guy behind [Radio Silence](http://radiosilenceapp.com) and [Private Eye](http://radiosilenceapp.com/private-eye). BozoCrack was rewritten in Python by [Henrique Pereira](http://twitter.com/ikkebr).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nDo whatever you wish.
